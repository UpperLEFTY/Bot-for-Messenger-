The best way to get started with building this chatbot is to create an app on the Facebook Developer platform.
This will get your Facebook app ready, but in order to test it, you will need to develop a webhook.
All messages and data from Facebook will come to our app via this HTTP endpoint. 
In order to test webhooks, we need a server to forward live webhooks to our localhost.
For live testing, we will use a service called Ngrok.
